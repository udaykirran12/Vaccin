## Description
A web application specifically designed for booking COVID-19 vaccinations. The application consists of distinct modules catering to the needs of both users and administrators. Users and administrators are able to sign up and log in to their respective accounts, ensuring secure access to the system. Additionally, I implemented comprehensive CRUD operations within the admin module, empowering administrators to efficiently manage and update available vaccination slots, vaccination center information, and other essential data.
